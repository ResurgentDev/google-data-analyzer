‚ö†Ô∏è **Work-in-Progress (WIP)** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This repository is part of my ongoing personal learning journey as I explore development tools, concepts, and practices. While there may be other tools available that achieve similar tasks, this repository serves an educational purpose, showcasing my exploration and development skills.

I‚Äôm sharing this repository to:
- **Invite constructive feedback** to accelerate my learning.
- **Help others** who might benefit from similar exploration.
- **Engage potential collaborators** or employers who value growth and curiosity.

üí° While this project is still evolving, I welcome discussions, suggestions, and connections that could help me refine and expand my work.

Currently, collaboration is not actively sought. However, if you find value in this project and believe it could grow into something impactful, feel free to reach out for discussions on potential collaboration!

# Google Data Analyzer

This repository provides a tool for parsing and analyzing Google Takeout data, starting with email data (MBOX format). While many existing tools can handle specific types of Google Takeout data, they lack integration across different formats and services. The **Google Data Analyzer** aims to address these limitations and lay the groundwork for future extensibility, enabling users to manage and analyze their data more effectively.

---

## Purpose

Google Takeout allows users to download data from various services, including Gmail, Google Photos, Calendar, Drive, and more. However, managing this data can be challenging due to fragmentation across different formats. This tool begins with a focus on parsing email data while exploring possibilities for broader integration in future versions.

---

## Latest Changes (v0.3.0)
The project has undergone significant improvements in version 0.3.0:
- Added test mbox generator for creating reproducible test data
- Expanded test coverage with comprehensive test cases
- Added support for various email formats, encodings, and attachments

Previous changes (v0.2.0):
- Complete code reorganization for better maintainability
- Added comprehensive test suite with pytest
- Enhanced code modularity and organization
---
## Current Features

- **Email Parsing (MBOX Format):**
  - Extract, search, and organize email data from Google Takeout MBOX files.

---

## Future Plans

The Google Data Analyzer aims to expand its capabilities to address the following limitations of existing tools:

### Built-in Tools‚Äô Limitations and Planned Solutions

1. **Email Data (MBOX Files):**
   - Current tools (e.g., Thunderbird, Mailbird) handle emails well but don‚Äôt support integration with other Takeout data.
   - **Solution**: Provide advanced analytics and cross-referencing with data from other Google services, such as Calendar or Contacts.

2. **Photos & Videos (Google Photos):**
   - Tools like Google Photos or Adobe Lightroom are limited to images/videos and don‚Äôt analyze or integrate with other Takeout data types.
   - **Solution**: Enable tagging, organizing, and searching across photos alongside emails and calendar events.

3. **Google Drive Data (Docs, Sheets, Slides):**
   - Existing solutions re-upload Takeout files or use standalone office software, which doesn‚Äôt integrate other data types.
   - **Solution**: Incorporate search and organization tools for Google Drive files alongside emails and photos.

4. **Contacts:**
   - Tools like Google Contacts or Contacts+ manage contacts but don‚Äôt integrate them with emails or other Takeout data types.
   - **Solution**: Enable relational insights between contacts, emails, and calendar events.

5. **Calendar Events:**
   - Tools like Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar handle `.ics` files but don‚Äôt offer powerful searching across all Takeout data formats.
   - **Solution**: Provide a unified timeline of emails, events, and other metadata for enhanced productivity.

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Complexity**: Integrating multiple data formats (emails, images, docs, etc.) will require thoughtful design and modular architecture.
2. **Data Security**: Handling sensitive personal data from Google Takeout demands rigorous privacy and security measures.
3. **Scalability**: The tool should handle large data sets efficiently while maintaining a seamless user experience.

---

## Getting Started

To use the Google Data Analyzer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google-data-analyzer.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Analyze MBOX Files**:

   Provide an MBOX file from Google Takeout, and the tool will parse and present organized data.
   
4. **Generate Test Data** (for development/testing):
   ```bash
   python ./tests/data/generate_test_mbox.py --count [16|32]
   ```
   
   This creates sample mbox files with varied email formats for testing and development.
## Future Enhancements

In addition to the planned solutions for existing tools‚Äô limitations, the following features are on the roadmap:

   - Support for additional Google services (e.g., Calendar, Contacts, Drive).
   - Unified dashboard for seamless navigation across all data types.
   - Powerful search and tagging functionality.
   - Integration with external services like Dropbox or AWS for backups.

## Educational Purpose

This repository is a work-in-progress (WIP) and is primarily intended for educational purposes. While there are existing tools that perform similar tasks, the Google Data Analyzer is a personal learning project that showcases problem-solving and development skills. Collaboration is not currently active, but interested developers are welcome to discuss potential contributions.
