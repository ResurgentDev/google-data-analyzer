## Description
The tests in `test_statistics.py` have been rewritten and improved significantly, but some areas could still benefit from greater robustness to ensure future-proofing.

## Current State
- Improved tests now cover core functionality comprehensively.
- However, certain aspects like edge cases and error handling still require revisiting.
- Some tests rely on approximate floating-point comparisons which could be further refined.

## Steps to Resolve
1. Evaluate remaining gaps in test coverage (e.g., edge cases, additional error handling).
2. Explore replacing approximate comparisons (`pytest.approx`) with precise checks where feasible.
3. Validate whether additional statistical functions require new test cases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive edge case coverage for all statistical functions.
- [ ] Precise floating-point validation implemented (if appropriate).
- [ ] Tests remain clean and efficient.

## Priority
Low

## Additional Notes
With `test_statistics.py` now functional and comprehensive, further improvements should focus on fine-tuning and long-term reliability enhancements.
